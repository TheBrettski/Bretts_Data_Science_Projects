# Bretts_Data_Visualization_Proj1
This project generates two visualizations. The first one will be a plot to summarize the results of a survey that was conducted to 
gauge an audience interest in different data science topics. The second plot is a Choropleth map of the crime rate in San Francisco. 
This notebook is my final project submission for the Data Visualization with Python Course, part of the IBM Data Science Professional 
Certificate (Coursera).

To see the appropriate rendering of the map in the jupyter notebook, please view the file here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TheBrettski/Bretts_Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Brett%27s%20Data%20Visualization%20Skills-Proj1.ipynb
